When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on a system that is not your own or that you are afraid will die and lose all your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may have made changes on your local version that would be erased if Git automatically pulled from GitHub.
