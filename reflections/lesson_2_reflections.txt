What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You set it up to start tracking commits using git.  Git won't start to
track until you initialize a directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary place where you put your files that will be committed from the working directory to the repository at the next commit.  It allows you to only put certain files in the commit and to see which files are in there before committing.
