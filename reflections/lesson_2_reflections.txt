What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You set it up to start tracking commits using git.  Git won't start to
track until you initialize a directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary place where you put your files that will be committed from the working directory to the repository at the next commit.  It allows you to only put certain files in the commit and to see which files are in there before committing.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By using git diff --staged, I can compare the staging area with the last commit to make sure that only one logical change is included.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would help when I'm trying to experiment with an element that I may not want to keep.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams help show when commits are unreachable and which commits are reachable by which branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

It combines changes from both branches into one repo.  We show it that way so that the commit history is more clear.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

It's great because it can take out a lot of the work, but sometimes it could make a mistake.  Doing it all manually
would be very time consuming.
